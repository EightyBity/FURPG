If this asset seems short on content, that's because it's a free sample!
It deliberately only has the walk cycle and jump animation of the character sprite.
You can use the included sheets and visible frames to test out the system in your game (you may even use it commercially if you wish).
If you like it, you can purchase the full version to unlock a wide variety of new animations, outfits, and hairstyles.
